Hi, Iâ€™m Aafia â€” a recent graduate with MS in Molecular Biology and Microbiology along with Stem Cell Internship and Lab-based learning (SCILL) program from San Jose State University. Over the past year, I worked as a research intern in Majeti Lab at Stanford School of Medicine on my research project on "Targetting CD33+ AML cells via Gemtuzumab-conjugated LNPs" 

Iâ€™m passionate about targeted cellular immunotherapies for various types of cancer. 

This site is a space to share my thoughts, blog posts, and updates on my work.
